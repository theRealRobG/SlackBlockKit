# SlackBlockKit
The purpose of this package is to provide a strongly typed, codable representation of Slack Block Kit specification,
so that it can be used for creating Slack apps, when used in conjunction with Swift server.

The structure of each block has been taken from definitions provided via Slack's website [here](https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit).
